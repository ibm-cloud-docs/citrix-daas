# Using the Pricing calculator to estimate your monthly cost per user per month
{: #pricing-calculator-monthly-cost}

The pricing information for your system resources is shown on the side of the provisioining window and shows all of your equipment and physical resource costs. To view the cost estimates for your organization on a per user basis, use the pricing calculator. You can get estimates for different configurations before you begin provisioning. The pricing calculator is on the DaaS estimate tab on the main Citrix-DaaS product page. 

## What the pricing calculator does
{: #what-it-does}

The pricing calculator looks at several factors to estimate your cost and savings with different Citrix-DaaS configurations:

1.  The geographic area and region where your resources are located.  
2.  The number of users that use your system.
3.  The operating system that your system uses.
4.  The boot volume size on your system.
5.  The profile settings for your system, including the image to use, CPU, RAM, etc.

The calculator takes the inputs and creates a per user estimate for your configuration.

## Calculating cost per user for your system
{: #procedure-calculating-costs}

To calculate the cost per users for your Citrix-DaaS configuration:

1.  From the Citrix-DaaS product page, select the **DaaS estimate** tab. The pricing calculator is shown.
2.  Enter the geographic, user, OS, and boot volume information for your system.  
3.  Verify that the profile settings listed match your system or match the system that you are estimating. If they do not match, select **Change Profile** to enter the correct profile information. 

The calculator shows you the cost estimate per user for your system. 

If you want to see estimates for different profiles, or different numbers of users, modify the specific fields to see new estimates.
